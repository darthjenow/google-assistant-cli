# google-assistant-cli
Heavily based on [this](https://github.com/endoplasmic/google-assistant/blob/master/examples/console-input.js).

Added a possibility to use commandline arguments. If there aren't any present, show a prompt asking for the request.

## Usage
Initialize with ``yarn install``.

Send requests with
```console
node index.js light on
```
